# NGcodeX DevOps Introduction

## What is DevOps?ðŸ˜Š

**DevOps** is a set of practices that aim to automate and improve the collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The goal is to shorten the systems development life cycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.

## NGcodeX DevOps ProjectðŸ˜‡

In this repository, we explore and implement DevOps practices using Microsoft Azure.

## Key Concepts

### Continuous Integration (CI)

- **What is CI?** Continuous Integration is the practice of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. It involves automatically building and testing the code.

### Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)

- **What is CD?** Continuous Deployment/Delivery is the practice of automatically deploying code changes to a testing or production environment after passing CI. It ensures a streamlined and automated release process.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- **What is IaC?** Infrastructure as Code involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable script files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
